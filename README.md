Radioactive is a Javascript library that allows you to work with reactive, non-reactive, sync and async data sources as simple Javascript Expressions.

* [github.com/radioactive](https://github.com/radioactive)
* Stack Overflow Tag: `[radioactive]`


## The simple explanation:

* Radioactive allows you work with javascript functions that auto-update when their value changes. Most people use it to bind data to a UI, for example. 
* Radioactive also knows how to deal with asynchronous without using callbacks. This allows you to mix and match data coming from any source.

## A more advanced explanation

`reactivity.js` is a cannonical implementation of the [Native Reactivity](https://github.com/aldonline/reactivity/wiki/Native-Reactivity) pattern. It exposes reactive streams of data as pure javascript expressions.
Additionally, in order to reconcile sync and async datasources, radioactive integrates [Forced Execution Suspension](https://github.com/aldonline/reactivity/wiki/Forced-Execution-Suspension) and [Stateful Service Lifecycle Management](https://github.com/aldonline/reactivity/wiki/Stateful-Service-Lifecycle-Management).
The end result is a pure javascript environment where you can transparently mix and match expressions that are reactive, non-reactive, synchronous or asynchronous!

You can essentially represent ANY expression that returns data as a reactive expression.

No more [DonkeyScript](https://www.donkeyscript.org/)!


## Can you show me some examples?

Sure. Here's an example that will print out the time every second:

```javascript
reactivity.react(function(){
  console.log("The current time is " + getTime() )
})
```

The getTime() function is a `radioactive expression`. It returns a value just like a regular function, but it also emits an event whenever its value changes. The `radioactive.react()` function knows how to listen for these events and as soon as they occurr it will re-evaluate whatever it contains.

In order for this to work, the `getTime()` function must `notify` that its value has changed.

# Overview

In a very basic sense, Radioactive hast two parts:

* Publish ( use `radioactive.notifier()` )
* Consumer ( use `radioactive.react()` )

We say that a function is radioactive if it can notify us when its value has changed.
( somebody was kind enough to create a radioactive.notifier() under the covers )

# Installation

## NPM

```bash
npm install radioactive
```

```javascript
var radioactive = require('radioactive')

radioactive.react(function(){
  console.log( radioactive.time() );
})
```

## Browser

### Using Bower

```bash
bower install radioactive
```

### Manually

Include the following JS file ( you can find it in /dist/... )

```html
<script src="radioactive.min.js"></script>
```

In the browser, the global `radioactive` object is attached to the root scope ( window )

```javascript
var radioactive = window.radioactive

radioactive.react(function(){
  console.log( radioactive.time() );
})
```

If the object is already present then the library won't mess things up.
It will proxy calls to the pre-existing implementation.
